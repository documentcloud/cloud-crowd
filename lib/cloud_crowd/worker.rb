  # The Worker, forked off from the Node when a new WorkUnit is received,
  # launches an Action for processing. Workers will only ever receive WorkUnits
  # that they are able to handle (for which they have a corresponding action in
  # their actions directory). If communication with the central server is
  # interrupted, the Worker will repeatedly attempt to complete its unit --
  # every Worker::RETRY_WAIT seconds. Any exceptions that take place during
  # the course of the Action will cause the Worker to mark the WorkUnit as
  # having failed. When finished, the Worker's process exits, minimizing the
  # potential for memory leaks.
