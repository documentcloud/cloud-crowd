# The following settings allow you to control the number of workers that can run
# on a given node, to prevent the node from becoming overloaded. 'max_workers'
# is a simple cap on the maximum number of workers a node is allowed to run
# concurrently. 'max_load' is the maximum (one-minute) load average, above which
# a node will refuse to take new work. 'min_free_memory' is the minimum amount
# of free RAM (in megabytes) a node is allowed to have, below which no new
# workers are run. These settings may be used in any combination.

# The storage back-end that you'd like to use for intermediate and final results

# be used in development, on single-machine installations, or networked drives.
# If you *are* developing an action, filesystem is certainly faster and easier.

# Choose an S3 bucket to store all CloudCrowd output, and decide if you'd like

# The following settings configure local paths. 'local_storage_path' is the
