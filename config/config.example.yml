# The following settings allow you to control the number of workers that can run
# on a given node, to prevent the node from becoming overloaded. 'max_workers' 
# is a simple cap on the maximum number of workers a node is allowed to run
# concurrently. 'max_load' is the maximum (one-minute) load average, above which
# a node will refuse to take new work. 'min_free_memory' is the minimum amount
# of free RAM (in megabytes) a node is allowed to have, below which no new 
# workers are run. These settings may be used in any combination.

# The storage back-end that you'd like to use for intermediate and final results

# Choose an S3 bucket to store all CloudCrowd output, and decide if you'd like
