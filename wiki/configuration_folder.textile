The *configuration folder* is all that you need to deploy to a given machine (apart from the *cloud-crowd* gem itself) to make it into a productive citizen of your CloudCrowd cluster. Its contents include... 

h2. config.yml

*config.yml* is the main CloudCrowd configuration file. It contains all the fiddly little settings that you'll want to tweak to get your installation running smoothly. Here's the rundown of everything you can specify:

|*central_server*|The URL to the *central server*. If you're developing, this is probably localhost. If you've got a full production deployment, then this is probably aiming at your *load balancer*. If you're running an internal CloudCrowd installation, this DNS probably only resolves on your local network.|
|*max_workers*|The maximum number of @Workers@ that a @Node@ is allowed to run. If a node reaches this number, it will be considered 'busy', and will have to wait for some of its workers to finish processing before accepting any new @WorkUnits@.|
|*max_load*|The highest that the (one-minute) load average is allowed to climb before a @Node@ starts refusing to take any more work. When the load drops back down, the node starts receiving work again. The optimal value for this depends on the number of processors in your node, and is probably higher than you expect -- the load average trails the actual load over the course of a minute, and this may aggravate spiky behavior.|
|*min_free_memory*|The lowest that available memory can drop before the node refuses to take more work. Measured in megabytes. This, in conjunction with *max_workers*, is a good way to ensure that your node doesn't start to swap.|
|*storage*|'*s3*' or '*filesystem*'. The storage system used by the @AssetStore@ to store work unit results. 'filesystem' storage is only appropriate in development, on single-machine installations, or if you have a networked volume handy.|
|*aws_access_key*|Your Amazon Web Services *access key*, for S3 storage.|
|*aws_secret_key*|Your Amazon Web Services *secret access key*, for S3 storage.|
|*s3_bucket*|The S3 bucket you'd like to store your CloudCrowd results in.|
|*s3_authentication*|If this option is turned on with S3 storage, all results will be saved as private files, and the URLs returned will be temporarily authenticated for 24 hours|
|*http_authentication*|If this option is turned on, all communication with the central server, including web requests to view the Operations Center, API calls, and requests to and from Nodes, will use HTTP basic authentication with the login and password specified.|
|*login*|The common login for all CloudCrowd requests via HTTP basic authentication, if enabled.|
|*password*|The password for all CloudCrowd requests via HTTP basic authentication, if enabled.|
|*actions_path*|By default CloudCrowd looks in the 'actions' subdirectory of the *configuration folder* for all your installed actions. If you'd prefer to keep them somewhere else, you can specify an *actions_path*.|
|*work_unit_retries*|The number of separate attempts that will be made to process an individual @WorkUnit@ before marking it as failed.|
|*local_storage_path*|If using the '*filesystem*' storage, all results will be saved inside of this directory. The default value is @'/tmp/cloud_crowd_storage'@. Useful if you have a networked drive.|
|*log_path*|Directory for storing server and node log files if daemonized. Defaults to @log@.|
|*pid_path*|Directory for storing server and node PID files if daemonized. Defaults to @tmp/pids@.|


h2. database.yml

CloudCrowd uses ActiveRecord to manage the central server's database, so you can use the standard configuration for any ActiveRecord compatible database. See the "ActiveRecord Documentation":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002364 for more information.

To load the CloudCrowd schema into the database specified by *database.yml*, use:

<pre>
crowd -c /path/to/configuration/folder load_schema
</pre>

h2. actions

Please install all of the Ruby files for your custom actions into the *actions* folder. Actions are dispatched by file and class name, so a @WebScraper@ action should be filed in @actions/web_scraper.rb@, and should be invoked by specifying @action : 'web_scraper'@ in your job creation request. The actions folder has an interesting property that you can take advantage of: Nodes will only receive work for the actions that have been installed in their configuration folder. If you'd like to specialize some of the machines in your cluster to only perform specific, higher priority actions, then simply include only those actions that you wish to run.

h2. config.ru

*config.ru* is a standard Rackup file that can be used by Rack-compliant servers, such as Thin, Passenger, and Unicorn to launch instances of the central server. For example, to launch three instances using Thin:

<pre>
thin start -R config.ru -p 9173 --servers 3
</pre>
